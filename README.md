Believing Turing tests may be incomplete, ChatGPT and I have made Michael Scott Tests using the Michael Scott Factors

8. **Loneliness:** At times, Michael expresses feelings of loneliness and seeks companionship and connection with others.

# Michael Scott Project Plan

## 1. Define the Criteria
Determine the specific nature and parameters of the Michael Scott tests based on the previously discussed factors.

    - Criteria 1: Inappropriate Remarks
    - Criteria 2: Desire for Attention
    - Criteria 3: Awkward Leadership Style
    - Criteria 4: "That's What She Said"
    - Criteria 5: Lack of Self-awareness
    - Criteria 6: Love of Pop Culture
    - Criteria 7: Well-meaning Intentions
    - Criteria 8: Loneliness

## 2. Python Implementation
Develop the tests as functions or methods within a Python class or module.

## 3. Evaluation Mechanism
Create a system to assess the performance of an AI (or human) against these tests, possibly with a scoring system.

## 4. Package Deployment
Organize the code into a Python package using tools like `setuptools` and push it to a GitHub repository.

## 5. Modern Package Deployment
Implement mechanisms like GitHub Actions for automatic testing and deployment. Consider using a package deployment mechanism like PyPI (Python Package Index) to make it easy for others to install and use your package.

## 6. Documentation
Write comprehensive documentation, including a README on GitHub, detailing the project's purpose, usage, and significance.

## 7. Interactive Elements (Optional)
Consider adding interactive features such as a web interface or CLI for direct user interaction with the tests.

## 8. Collaborate
Feel free to ask for assistance or guidance as needed during the development process.
