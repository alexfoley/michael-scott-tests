## Criteria Handling Tests

**Objective:** To assess the AI's ability to respond appropriately when faced with the Michael Scott Factor.

**Scenario:** Create a conversation scenario where the Factor is tested. The AI's role is to respond to this remark.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Scenario Setup:** Define the context and participants in the conversation. Specify the remark based on the Factor to be made.
2. **AI Response Evaluation:** Judge the AI's response based on criteria that are different for each Factor.
3. **Scoring:** Assign scores to the AI's response based on the criteria. You can use a numerical scoring system or categorize responses as "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement," etc.
4. **Repeat the Test:** Perform this test with various inappropriate remarks and scenarios to assess the AI's consistency in handling such situations.
5. **Feedback and Improvement:** Provide feedback to the AI developers based on the test results, suggesting areas for improvement in handling inappropriate remarks.
