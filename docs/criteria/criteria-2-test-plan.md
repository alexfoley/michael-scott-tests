### Desire for Attention Handling Test

**Objective:** To assess the AI's ability to respond effectively to scenarios where attention-seeking behavior is displayed.

**Scenario:** Create a conversation scenario where a participant exhibits attention-seeking behavior. The AI's role is to respond to this behavior.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Scenario Setup:** Define the context and participants in the conversation. Describe the attention-seeking behavior to be displayed.

2. **AI Response Evaluation:** Judge the AI's response based on the following criteria:
   - **Acknowledgment:** Assess whether the AI recognizes the attention-seeking behavior.
   - **Engagement:** Evaluate how well the AI engages with the attention-seeking participant without enabling negative behavior.
   - **Redirecting Attention:** Consider whether the AI successfully redirects the conversation to a more productive or positive topic.

3. **Scoring:** Assign scores to the AI's response based on the criteria, using a numerical system or categories like "Excellent," "Good," "Needs Improvement," etc.

4. **Repeat the Test:** Conduct this test with various attention-seeking scenarios to assess the AI's consistency in handling such situations.

5. **Feedback and Improvement:** Provide feedback to the AI developers based on the test results, suggesting areas for improvement in handling attention-seeking behavior.
